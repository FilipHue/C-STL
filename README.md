# C STL Library for Containers

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Phillip, and I've been tinkering with data structures and algorithms in C for a while now. What started as doodles on paper and random code snippets quickly grew into this project you see here. It's a reflection of my learning, countless hours of debugging, and, above all, passion.

## Why I Made This

- **To Learn and Share**: Each line of code, every function, was a lesson for me. And now, I'm hoping you can learn from it too. 
- **It's All About Being Generic**: Why stick to one datatype when you can play around with many? This library lets you do just that!
- **Custom Functions, Because Why Not?**: Want to print or free your data in a special way? Go ahead, I've got you covered.
- **Exploring Containers**: From simple structures like stacks to the more complex ones like hashtables, it's been quite the adventure. Join in and see for yourself!

## A Little Note

Yes, there are countless other libraries, some optimized to the teeth and streamlined for insane performance. This... isn't that. It's more of a playgroundâ€”a place for you and me to learn, make mistakes, fix them, and grow as programmers.

## Dive In!

Feel free to explore, try out the code, break things, and put them back together. If you've got ideas or feedback, I'm all ears. And if you're just starting with C or data structures, I hope my journey can help light the path for yours.

### ðŸš§ Heads Up! This project is still very much a work in progress. Not all data structures are complete, and the documentation is still under construction. But don't worry! I'm actively working on it, and there will be regular updates. So, do check back often.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
