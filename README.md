# C STL Library for Containers

Hey there! 👋 I'm Phillip, and I've been tinkering with data structures and algorithms in C for a while now. What started as doodles on paper and random code snippets quickly grew into this project you see here. It's a reflection of my learning, countless hours of debugging, and, above all, passion.

## Why I Made This

- **To Learn and Share**: Each line of code, every function, was a lesson for me. And now, I'm hoping you can learn from it too. 
- **It's All About Being Generic**: Why stick to one datatype when you can play around with many? This library lets you do just that!
- **Custom Functions, Because Why Not?**: Want to print or free your data in a special way? Go ahead, I've got you covered.
- **Exploring Containers**: From simple structures like stacks to the more complex ones like hashtables, it's been quite the adventure. Join in and see for yourself!

## A Little Note

Yes, there are other libraries, some optimized to the teeth and streamlined for insane performance. This... isn't that. It's more of a playground—a place for you and me to learn, make mistakes, fix them, and grow as programmers.

## Dive In!

Feel free to explore, try out the code, break things, and put them back together. If you've got ideas or feedback, I'm all ears. And if you're just starting with C or data structures, I hope my journey can help light the path for yours.

I’ll try my best to guide you through how these structures work and uncover the logic behind each of them. It’s a journey through pointers, lists, stacks, and more, aiming to leave you with a solid understanding.

Alright now, enough chit-chat, let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of what this repository has in store, shall we?

## A Peek into the Branches :deciduous_tree:

Navigating through a project can be a bit overwhelming, can't it? But don't worry, I've got you covered! This library plays around in two main branches: **main** and **development**. Let's break it down:

### Main Branch – Your Go-To for Stability 🛡️
- **[Main Branch](https://github.com/FilipHue/C-STL/tree/main)**: This is where the magic happens after everything is tried and tested. It’s your safe space for stable code (hopefully :smile:).
  - **Source Code Galore** 📁: Peek inside the [**src**](src/) folder, and you'll find the heart of the library, all polished and ready to go.
  - **Easy Peasy Compilation** ⚙️: The [**Makefile**](Makefile) is there to make your life easier, helping you compile everything without breaking a sweat.
  - **Quick Start with main.c** 🧪: Wanna dive right in? The [**main.c**](main.c) file is your quick entry ticket to test the containers.

### Development Branch – For the Brave and Bold 🛠️
- **[Development Branch](https://github.com/FilipHue/C-STL/tree/development)**: This is the playground! It’s the creative (and sometimes chaotic) space where new features are born.
  - **Test and Learn**: Curious about how things work? Check out the [**test**](https://github.com/FilipHue/C-STL/tree/development/test) folder to see the containers in action and grab some insights 🧐.

So there you have it! I've tried to keep things clear and easy to navigate, just like I hope your experience will be with this library. Dive in, explore, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about code.

### 🚧 Heads Up! This project is still very much a work in progress. Not all data structures are complete, and the documentation is still under construction. But don't worry! I'm actively working on it, and there will be regular updates. So, do check back often.

Happy coding! 🚀
